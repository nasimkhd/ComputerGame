 Introduction:
 
 You will be programming a small game that has hidden bombs and treasure along a path
of variable distance. The game requires the player to enter move location commands to reveal what is
hidden at a given position along the path. The object of the game is for the player to find as many
treasures as possible before running out of moves or lives. Discovering a bomb will reduce the player’s
life count. Discovering a treasure will earn the player treasure points. Discovering both, a treasure
with a bomb in the same location will reduce the player’s life count and earn the player treasure points
(consider it a life insurance payout). Prior to playing the game, the program will prompt the user to
perform some upfront configurations to the player and the game components – these settings will
define how the game is played.
